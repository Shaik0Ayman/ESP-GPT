# ESP-GPT
ESP-GPT is a project designed to leverage the ESP32 microcontroller to connect to OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and host a language model on a small OLED display. This setup allows for interaction with the language model directly from the ESP32 device, making it a compact and portable solution for various applications.
